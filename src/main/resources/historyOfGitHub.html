</section>

<main>
    <p> GitHub, Inc. is a United States-based global company that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired the company in 2018 for US$7.5 billion.[3] It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[4]</p>
    <br>
    <p>GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional and enterprise services are commercial.[5] Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open-source projects.[6] As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free.[7] Starting from April 15, 2020, the free plan allows unlimited collaborators, but restricts private repositories to 2,000 actions minutes per month.[8] As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users[9] and more than 100 million repositories[10] (including at least 28 million public repositories),[11] making it the largest host of source code in the world.[12]</p>
    <br>
    <p>The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco.[13]</p>
    <br>
    <p>The shading of the map illustrates the number of users as a proportion of each country's Internet population. The circular charts surrounding the two hemispheres depict the total number of GitHub users (left) and commits (right) per country.</p>
    <br>
    <p>On February 24, 2009, GitHub team members announced, in a talk at Yahoo! headquarters, that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month alone. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once and 4,600 had been merged.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In 2009, GitHub announced that the site was being harnessed by over 100,000 users. In another 2009 interview with Yahoo!, Preston-Werner announced that GitHub had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.[14]</p>
    <br>
    <p>In 2010, GitHub announced that it was hosting 1 million repositories.[15] A year later, this number doubled.[16] ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.[17] On January 16, 2013, GitHub announced it had passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[18] By the end of the year, the number of repositories were twice as much, reaching 10 million repositories.[19]</p>
    <br>
    <p>In 2012, GitHub raised $100 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz with $750 million valuation.[20] Peter Levine, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, stated that GitHub had been growing revenue at 300% annually since 2008 "profitably nearly the entire way".[21] On July 29, 2015, GitHub announced it had raised $250 million in funding in a round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors of this round include Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and IVP (Institutional Venture Partners).[22] The round valued the company at approximately $2 billion.[23]</p>
