        <p>OOP Concepts has become an important part of software
            development. Writing Programs using Top down approach of traditional structured
            programming or Functional Programming method becomes difficult as the
            complexity of the program increases. This is where Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
            comes in handy. </p>

        <p>OOP Concepts allows you to break these complex programs into
            small bytes, which you can solve one by one. OOP is an effective model that
            allows your program to grow without becoming impossible to maintain. Add to it the
            ubiquity of languages like Java, and OOP Principles becomes need of the hour.</p>

        <p>OOP
            is a whole new way of addressing problems. Here you create a class, instead of
            writing a program, which has variables and functions. </p>

        <p>Objects
            are self-contained examples of that class and you have a control where you can
            make them interact with each other in many ways. This kind of encapsulation
            makes knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming and its main Principles a must
            if you are serious about working on big projects and developing software for
            mobiles. </p>

        <p>
            There are many important features of Object-Oriented Programming. However, before proceeding further, we suggest you read
            <a href="https://blog.simpliv.com/blog/how-to-learn-java-from-scratch-in-2019/">

        <p>Let

            discuss them with relevant examples.</p>

        <p style="color:#23acb3">
            <strong>What are OOP Concepts?</strong>
        </p>
        </p>

        <p>Object
            Oriented Programming is a method based on the concepts of “objects” which
            contain data and methods. Its main objective is to bring flexibility in
            programming while building small and large software applications. Most of the
            programming language like Java, C++, Python, C#, etc. follow OOP concepts.</p>

                    <strong>Object</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>What is an Object? It is a commonly asked
            question. An object is an entity which has both state and behavior. An object can
            be defined as an instance of a class, which contains the address and takes up
            some space in the memory. </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            <strong>Some
                of the key points of objects are:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>It has a state</li>
            <li>It has a behavior</li>
            <li>It has an identity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Consider
                an example to understand what is an object:</strong>
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>Consider writing pen as an example. Here, pen
            is an object and its name is Reynolds, and color is white, known as its state. Pen
            is used to write is its behavior.</p>

        <p>
            A keyword
            <em>“new”</em>

            is used to create objects in Java.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Object
                is created with the following syntax:</strong>
        </p>

        <p>className ReferenceVariable = new
            ClassName();</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p style="color:#23acb3">
                    <strong>Class:</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            What is a Class? It is another commonly asked
            question by the community. A Class can be considered as blueprint using which many numbers
            of objects can be created. It is a group of objects which have common
            properties. Class contains
            <strong>variables and
                methods</strong>
            to describe the behavior of an object.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Consider a house as an example to understand
                what is class:</strong>
            <br>
        </p>

        <div class="wp-block-image">
            <figure class="alignright">

            </figure>
        </div>

        <p>Here,
            the house is the object. All the properties of the house such as floors, doors,
            window, etc. can be considered as the different classes. </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Syntax to declare class is:</strong>
        </p>

        <p>

            class
            <br>

            {
            <br>

            Field;
            <br>

            Methods;
            <br>

            }
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>A Class in Java contains:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fields</li>
            <li>Methods</li>
            <li>Constructors</li>
            <li>Blocks</li>
            <li>Nested class and interface.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="color:#23acb3">
            <strong>What
                is the difference between Object and Class?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Object and Class are the main concepts of Objecting Oriented Programming
            concepts. We will discuss some of the difference between these two concepts:</p>

        <table class="wp-block-table">
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <strong>Object</strong>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Class</strong>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Object is the instance of a class.   </td>
                <td>Class is blueprint or a template from which objects will be created.   </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    An object is self-contained component
                    <br>
                    which consists methods and properties which help in making a certain type of data useful.
                </td>
                <td>A class is an entity which determines how the object will behave and what&nbsp;it contains.   </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>An object can be created many times as per the requirement.   </td>
                <td>A class is declared only once.    </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>An object allocates memory whenever it is created.   </td>
                <td>A class doesn’t take memory whenever it is created.   </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Once we have learned the Object
            and Class, then we will see further OOPs Concepts of Java.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p style="color:#23acb3">
                    <strong>Inheritance</strong>
                    :
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It can be defined as the process where one class acquires the
            properties of another class using a keyword called ‘
            <strong>extends’</strong>
            . Here, the class which inheritance the properties of other
            class is called ‘
            <strong>subclass’,</strong>
            and the
            class whose properties are inherited are called ‘
            <strong>superclass’</strong>
            .
        </p>

        <p>Inheritance is mainly used for code reusability. So, here you are making use of existing classes and further extending on that. Let us look into a programming example of inheritance concept. </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Let us look for a sample inheritance program.</strong>

                    <strong>Polymorphism</strong>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is an Object-Oriented Programming feature which allows the
            programmer to perform a single action in many ways. The common use of
            polymorphism is when a parent class reference is used to refer a child class
            object. </p>

        <p style="color:#23acb3">
            <strong>Different types of polymorphism:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>

                    <span style="color:#23acb3">Static polymorphism:</span>
                </strong>
                This is a type of
                polymorphism which gets resolved during compilation. It is also called compile time
                polymorphism.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <span style="color:#23acb3">Dynamic polymorphism:</span>
                </strong>
                This is a type of
                polymorphism in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime. So,
                it is called runtime polymorphism.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>

                <p style="color:#23acb3">
                    <strong>Encapsulation</strong>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Encapsulation means binding object state and behavior together.
            It is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variable) and code acting on the data
            (methods) together as a single unit. It is a called as data hiding as variables
            of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through
            the methods of their current class.</p>

        <p>An
            encapsulated class can be created by making all the data members of the class
            private.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p style="color:#23acb3">
                    <strong>Abstraction</strong>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details
            from the user, here only the functionality will be provided to the user. Abstract
            class contains ‘abstract’ keyword. Here, you show only relevant data and hide unnecessary
            details of an object from the user.</p>

        <p style="color:#23acb3">
            <strong>Let us discuss Abstraction
                with an example:</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Consider
            an example wherein you are using your bank account online, to login you will
            enter your user_id and password and then press the login button, after pressing
            the login button you will not know how the input data is sent to the server and
            how it gets verified as all this information is abstracted away from you.</p>

        <p style="color:#23acb3">
            <strong>What are the best practices of OOP Concept?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>The overall vision of implementing Object-Oriented
            Program is to develop a secure and more reliable software application. This
            requires following some proper guidelines while writing the programs which we
            will discuss below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        <span style="color:#23acb3">Single responsibility: </span>
                    </strong>
                    One of the important best practices that every developer needs to follow
                    is the “Single Responsibility Principle”. Here, in Object Oriented Programming,
                    the class should always have one functionality so that it is called or extended
                    whenever new usage arises without causing coupling between different
                    functionalities
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>

                    </strong>
                    This principle says that
                    keep all the methods and classes need to be closed for modifications but open
                    for extensions. It means to create software entities whose behavior can be
                    changed without editing and recompiling the code itself
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                    This
                    principle states that subtypes may be substitutable for their base types

                    This principle states that high-level modules, which provides complex
                    logic, should be easily reusable and they need to be unaffected by the changes
                    in low level modules, which provides utility features. Abstraction can be used
                    which decouples high-level and low-level modules from each other.

                reused across applications which helps in faster development</li>
            <li>OOP provides modular structure for programs wherein abstract
